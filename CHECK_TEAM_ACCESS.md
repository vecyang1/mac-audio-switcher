# Checking Your Team Access

## In App Store Connect:

1. **Click on your profile name** (Weibiao Pan) in the top right
2. Look for a **team selector** or organization name
3. You should see your friend's organization/team listed

## What to Look For:

- If you see multiple teams, select your friend's team
- The team name might be their company name or personal name
- Note the team name exactly as it appears

## Next Steps in Xcode:

Once you confirm you have access to your friend's team in App Store Connect:

1. **Go back to Xcode**
2. Click **"Add an Account..."** in the Team dropdown
3. Sign in with **viviscallers@gmail.com** (the same account you're using in App Store Connect)
4. After signing in, the Team dropdown should show your friend's team
5. Select that team (not "Personal Team")

## Important:

- You must use the SAME Apple ID in Xcode that has access in App Store Connect
- The team must have a paid Apple Developer Program membership
- You need "Developer" or "Admin" role to create certificates

If you don't see your friend's team in App Store Connect, the invitation might not have been properly set up.
